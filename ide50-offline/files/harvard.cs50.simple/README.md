# cs50.simple

CS50 IDE's menu simplification plugin. It supports two options:
* Less comfortable mode with reduced menu options and accessible functionality.
* More comfortable mode that returns menu options and functionality to its
original state.

No matter the mode, the "Run" button is changed to "Debug" and "Preview" is
removed.

It also adds functionality to Cloud9's IDE, including:
* A new option to change the terminal font size
* Adding tooltips to various buttons

## Getting Started
